This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset provided by CodeSoft, sourced from Kaggle. The task is to classify each transaction as either fraudulent or legitimate based on features such as transaction amount, location, time, and other related attributes.

Project Overview

Credit card fraud is one of the most common financial crimes, and detecting fraudulent transactions quickly is essential for minimizing losses and ensuring security. This project aims to create a classification model using machine learning algorithms to detect such frauds in credit card transactions.

The dataset contains various features related to credit card transactions, including transaction amount, time, and other anonymized features, which are then used to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and provided by CodeSoft. It consists of the following attributes:
	•	Time: The time of the transaction.
	•	Amount: The transaction amount.
	•	Features (V1-V28): Anonymized features, representing various aspects of the transaction.
	•	Class: Target variable where 1 represents a fraudulent transaction and 0 represents a legitimate transaction.

Modeling

For the fraud detection task, the following machine learning algorithms were used:
	1.	Logistic Regression: A baseline classification model used to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.
	2.	Decision Trees: A decision-based algorithm that splits data at various nodes to classify the transactions.
	3.	Random Forest: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for more robust performance.

These algorithms were trained on the dataset and evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Algorithms Used

1. Logistic Regression
	•	A linear model for binary classification, used to predict the probability that a transaction is fraudulent.

2. Decision Trees
	•	A tree-like model used to make decisions by splitting the dataset based on certain features, aiming to predict the target variable.

3. Random Forests
	•	An ensemble learning method that combines predictions from multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.

Requirements

The following libraries and packages are required to run this project:
	•	Python 3.x
	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	scikit-learn

These can be installed using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection


	2.	Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Download the dataset from the provided link (e.g., Kaggle) and place it in the data/ directory.

Usage
	1.	Load and Preprocess the Data:
	•	The data is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize the features, and encode categorical variables (if any).
	2.	Train the Model:
	•	The models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) are trained on the dataset, and their performance is evaluated.
	3.	Evaluate the Model:
	•	The models are evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

To run the script and train the model:

python train_model.py

Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
	•	Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified transactions.
	•	Precision: Proportion of correctly identified fraudulent transactions to all transactions predicted as fraudulent.
	•	Recall: Proportion of correctly identified fraudulent transactions to all actual fraudulent transactions.
	•	F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced performance measure.
